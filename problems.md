- Conditionals  
- Strings  
- Lists  
- Dictionaries

## 1. Even or Odd
Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints `"Even"` if the number is even, and `"Odd"` if the number is odd.

### Boiler Plate
``` python
def solve(x: int) -> None:
    # write your logic here and print 'Even' or 'Odd'

num = int(input())
solve(num)
```
#### Sample Input
```
7
```

#### Sample Output
```
Odd
```

#### Sample Input
```
10
```

#### Sample Output
```
Even
```

## 2. Maximum in a List
Write a program that takes a list of integers and finds the maximum value in the list.

### Boiler Plate
``` python
def solve(numbers: list[int]) -> int:
    # write your logic here and return the maximum number

n = int(input())
numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(solve(numbers))
```

#### Sample Input
```
5
3 8 1 9 2
```

#### Sample Output
```
9
```

#### Sample Input
```
4
-5 -2 -8 -1
```

#### Sample Output
```
-1
```

## 3. Reverse Input
Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the string in reverse order.

### Boiler Plate
``` python
def solve(text: str) -> str:
    # write your logic here and return the reversed string

text = input()
print(solve(text))
```

#### Sample Input
```
hello
```

#### Sample Output
```
olleh
```

#### Sample Input
```
Python
```

#### Sample Output
```
nohtyP
```

## 4. Character Frequency Counter
Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the frequency of each character, then prints the character and its count.

### Boiler Plate
``` python
def solve(text: str) -> None:
    # write your logic here and print character frequencies
    # format: "character: count" for each character in alphabetical order

text = input()
solve(text)
```

#### Sample Input
```
hello
```

#### Sample Output
```
e: 1
h: 1
l: 2
o: 1
```

#### Sample Input
```
programming
```

#### Sample Output
```
a: 1
g: 2
i: 1
m: 2
n: 1
o: 1
p: 1
r: 2
```

## 5. Two Sum Problem
Write a program that takes an array of integers and a target sum, then finds two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Print the indices of these two numbers (0-indexed).

### Boiler Plate
``` python
def solve(numbers: list[int], target: int) -> list:
    # write your logic here and return the indices of the two numbers
    # format: [index1, index2] where index1 < index2

n = int(input())
numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
target = int(input())
result = solve(numbers, target)
print(result[0], result[1])
```

#### Sample Input
```
4
2 7 11 15
9
```

#### Sample Output
```
0 1
```

#### Sample Input
```
3
3 2 4
6
```

#### Sample Output
```
1 2
```

## 6. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

### Boiler Plate
``` python
def solve(prices: list[int]) -> int:
    # write your logic here and return the maximum profit

n = int(input())
prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(solve(prices))
```

#### Sample Input
```
6
7 1 5 3 6 4
```

#### Sample Output
```
7
```

#### Sample Input
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

#### Sample Output
```
4
```

#### Sample Input
```
5
7 6 4 3 1
```

#### Sample Output
```
0
```
