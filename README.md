# MSC Orientation - Python Practice Problems

Welcome to the MSC orientation Python practice problems! This repository contains beginner-friendly programming exercises designed to help you get comfortable with Python fundamentals.

## What's Included

This repository contains 5 carefully selected problems that cover essential Python concepts:

- **Conditionals** (if/else statements)
- **Loops** (for/while loops)
- **Lists** (array operations)
- **Dictionaries** (key-value pairs)
- **Strings** (text manipulation)
- **Primary data types** (int, str, list, etc.)

## Problems Overview

| Problem | Difficulty | Key Concepts |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| 1. Even or Odd | Beginner | Conditionals, Modulo operator |
| 2. Maximum in a List | Beginner | Lists, Comparison operations |
| 3. Reverse Input | Beginner | String manipulation |
| 4. Character Frequency Counter | Intermediate | Dictionaries, Sorting |
| 5. Two Sum Problem | Intermediate | Lists, Nested loops, Hash maps |

## How to Use

1. Open the `problems.md` file to see all problem descriptions
2. Each problem includes:
   - Clear problem statement
   - Boilerplate code with type hints
   - Sample inputs and expected outputs
   - Function signature to guide your implementation

3. For each problem:
   - Copy the boilerplate code
   - Implement your solution in the `solve()` function
   - Test with the provided sample inputs
   - Verify your output matches the expected results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python syntax

### Running the Problems

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd msc-orientation
   ```

2. Create a Python file for your solution:
   ```bash
   touch solution.py
   ```

3. Copy the boilerplate code from `problems.md` and implement your solution

4. Run your solution:
   ```bash
   python solution.py
   ```

## Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Begin with problem 1 and work your way up
- **Read Carefully**: Pay attention to input/output formats
- **Test Thoroughly**: Try edge cases beyond the sample inputs
- **Think Before Coding**: Plan your approach before writing code
- **Use Type Hints**: The provided type hints will help guide your implementation

## Problem Structure

Each problem follows this consistent format:

```python
def solve(parameter: type) -> return_type:
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Input handling (provided)
# Function call (provided)
```

## Contributing

This is a learning repository. Focus on:
- Understanding the problem requirements
- Writing clean, readable code
- Testing your solutions thoroughly

## Support

If you have questions about any problem:
1. Review the problem description and sample inputs/outputs
2. Check your logic step by step
3. Ensure your output format matches exactly

Happy coding!
